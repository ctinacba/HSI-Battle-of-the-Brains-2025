HSI Battle of the Brains (Botb) | Front-end Winning Project | Fall 2025

Challenge: HSI BotB Fall 2025: "Design a business solution that leverages AI solutions (such as agentic AI, MCP, etc.) for automating ad placement or generative AI for real-time personalized content to enhance targeting, boost engagement, or optimize performance measurement. Your solution must also incorporate a sustainability strategy by designing AI models that use less computational power, optimizing data pipelines to reduce energy waste, or leveraging renewable-powered cloud infrastructure to reduce the environmental impact of AI. Teams should demonstrate both the technical feasibility and business impact of their solution, such as increased revenue, improved customer retention, or enhanced ad efficiency."
